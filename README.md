# Reload Addon

An addon that enables easy reloading of another addon.

This is useful when developing addons that need to be reloaded explicitly like for example `service` addons .It avoids the need to restart Kodi all the time

Reloading is done by executing this script. Since it is a script it can be bound to a key for quick access.
